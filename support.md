# Support
Please review the documentation before requesting support.  Most common questions are already answered in the FAQ.

If you have questions that are not already answered in the FAQ, or believe you identified a bug, our preferred method of communication is [GitHub](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribeocr).  Using GitHub allows other user users encountering similar issues to benefit from discussion.  Bug reports and feature requests should be reported in [Git Issues](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribeocr/issues), while general questions and discussion should occur within a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribeocr/discussions).  

If you need support and do not have a GitHub account, you can email <admin@scribeocr.com>.

If the issue you are asking about involves a specific document, you are more likely to receive a helpful response if you attach that document.  While we understand that not all documents can be shared, it is nearly impossible to troubleshoot issues along the lines of "the baseline is not calculated correctly for my document" without access to a document that produces the issue.
