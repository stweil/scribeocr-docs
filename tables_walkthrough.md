# Overview
This page provides a walkthrough for new users who want to extract tables from PDFs.  For more detailed reference material, see the [Table Extraction - Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/tables.html) page.

# Example: Simple Table
In this example, we will extract a single table from an Amazon 8K filing.  This table is simple, so extracting the data only takes a few steps.

### Step 1: Enable the Appropriate Options
Table extraction is an experimental/optional feature, so needs to be enabled manually.
1. Select `Info` -> `Optional Features` -> `Extract Tables` to enable table extraction.
2. If your document contains native text, select `Info` -> `Advanced Options` -> `Extract Text from PDF` to use the text already in the PDF.
	2. This option should only be enabled for native text documents--it should not be used for documents that contain an invisible OCR layer over images.
	3. This option must be set prior to uploading the document.

### Step 2: Upload Document, Create Text Layer
Upload your document and use Scribe OCR as you would normally to create a high-quality text layer.  This step is better documented on other pages, however the basics are listed below.

1. Upload your document along with (optionally) external OCR data (Tesseract `.hocr` or Abbyy `.xml`).
2. If you are not relying on existing text in the document, or uploading your own OCR data, run text recognition to create an OCR text layer.
	1. Select `Recognize` -> `Recognize Text`
3. If relying on OCR data--whether generated by Scribe OCR or uploaded--review the text layer and correct any errors.
	1. This step can be skipped when using the text layer from a text-native PDF.
	2. In all other cases, all OCR data is likely to contain a non-zero number of errors.

### Step 3: Add Table Layout
Use the tools in the `Layout` tab to draw a table over the text layer.  Start by selecting `Layout` -> `Add Data Table` and drawing a rectangle over the entire table.  This produces a single-column table, which is represented by a colored rectangle.

Next, add column separators to create a multi-column table.  To split a column, right click the table where the column divider should be added, and select `Split Column`.

Proceed to add the remaining columns.  The column bounds can be adjusted by dragging the column divider.  The image below shows a table with 5 columns, with the dividers positioned appropriately.

### Step 4: Export
Once the text layer and table layout are both accurate, it is time to export the data.  To export the table in a tabular format, select `Download` -> `Format` -> `Xlsx`, and then click `Download`.  A `.xlsx` file containing your table should download.

As a general practice, it is prudent to always download a `.hocr` file in addition the file format you ultimately want.  HOCR is the only format that allows for restoring an editing session later, so allows for fixing any mistakes you may notice in the future.
